# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using Python, YOLOv8, and EasyOCR 🚗🔍



## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-time **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system built using **Python**, **YOLOv8**, and **EasyOCR**. It detects license plates in images or videos and extracts the alphanumeric characters with high accuracy. This tool can be used in traffic surveillance, toll systems, parking management, and smart security systems.
